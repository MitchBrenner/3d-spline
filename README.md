# 🌐 3D Globe with Spline in Next.js

This project demonstrates how to integrate a **3D globe** created with **Spline** into a **Next.js** app.

## 🧑‍💻 What I Did

I messed around with **Spline** and created a simple 3D globe. This globe is embedded in a Next.js app using an `<iframe>`, allowing it to be displayed directly on the page.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the 3D globe in action.


## 🎨 Tools Used

- Next.js – for building the app
- Spline – for designing the 3D globe
